The U-Net architecture achieves very good performance on very different biomedical segmentation applications. U-net architecture (example for 32x32 pixels in the lowest resolution) as presented in Figure 1. Each blue box corresponds to a multi-channel feature map. The number of channels is denoted on top of the box. The x-y-size is provided at the lower left edge of the box. White boxes represent copied feature maps. The arrows denote the different operations. This work is based on [Ronneberger et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597).
